# cub3d
School 42's project "cub3d" implementation (no big bonuses, essentialy the mandatory part).
## Foreword
Hi there,

I'm Alexander,

Here's a clean version of cub3d created for School 42's curriculum.

I know how *frustrating* it is to work with minilibx, that's why I'm uploading my work to web for other students to see.

I tried to write my code in the clearest, most non-confusing way for you to understand. Hope this implementation will help you in completing this project.

The code itself should be self-explanatory.

Note that there are some functions used, such as `clock`, which are not permitted (this is flaw of the subject which should be fixed). However, they're required to fully respect the raycasting principles. You should be able to do some negotiations about this with your evaluators.
