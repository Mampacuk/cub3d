# cub3d
## Foreword
Hi there,

I'm Alexander,

Here's a clean version of cub3d created for School 42's curriculum.

I know how *frustrating* it is to work with minilibx, that's why I'm uploading my work to web for other students to see.

I tried to write my code in the clearest, most non-confusing way for you to understand. Hope this implementation will help you in completing this project.

The code itself should be self-explanatory.
## Sources
Here are the sources I used that helped me to figure out a lot:
*	https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx

## Known Issues
Please hit me up if you find a solution to the following problems:
*	The game doesn't resize the window when the resolution specified is bigger than the one of the native screen.
